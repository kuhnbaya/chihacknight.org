<h1>Breakout groups</h1>

<p>Every week after the presentation, we break out into topic-specific working and learning groups led by regular facilitators to guide conversations, answer questions, and build teams for civic apps. The groups are split into two types: <strong>working</strong> groups and <strong>learning</strong> groups.</p>

<p>Want to start your own breakout group? Just mention it at the next hack night and people will vote with their feet!</p>

<h3 id='learning'>Learning groups</h3>
<p>Educational sessions about civic technlogy, programming, working with data and troubleshooting help.</p>

        <p>A statistical model is used to predict the <em>E. coli</em> levels at Chicago's beaches to determine whether a beach advisory is issued to warn swimmers of potentially high levels of bacteria. However, the actual levels of bacteria is not known until the next day when lab tests have been completed. This project has the goal of increasing the accuracy of these statistical predictions, avoiding unnecessary beach advisories and correctly issuing advisories when bacteria is present.</p>

        <p>Teach Tech Task Force (T^3) is dedicated to identifying and supporting best practices for learning with civic technology.  We design tools and curricula to support learning in formal and informal settings. We take on projects to assist both in school and out of school time programs.  Our end goal is to train the next generation of civic technology leaders by finding new ways to support innovative programs and educators.  If you have a project idea or want to get involved, come to our working group!</p>

        <p>The “sharing economy” is much touted for its disruptive capabilities. Yet, many policy, legal, and regulatory issues intersect in nuanced ways in the “sharing economy.”  What are the long-term implications for customers/consumers and for low-wage workers who exist in the contradictory space between traditional, highly regulated systems and new, “disruptive” economic systems? How can technology be used to enhance the functionality of these systems and to strengthen consumer and driver’s rights?</p>
